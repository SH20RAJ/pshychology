# Chapter 28: Measuring Psychological Impact

> *"What gets measured gets managed, but in psychology, what gets measured also gets understood. The companies that master psychological measurement will dominate their markets."* - Psychology Metrics Institute

## Introduction

Measuring psychological impact is both the most challenging and most crucial aspect of building psychology-driven SaaS products. This chapter provides comprehensive frameworks for measuring psychological KPIs, tracking long-term psychological health, and calculating the ROI of psychological design investments.

Unlike traditional metrics that measure what happened, psychological metrics measure why it happened and predict what will happen. They provide insights into user motivation, emotional states, cognitive processes, and behavioral drivers that determine long-term product success and user loyalty.

## Section 1: Psychological KPIs and Metrics

### The Psychology Metrics Framework

Traditional SaaS metrics miss the psychological drivers of user behavior:

```

#### Cognitive Biases as Persuasive Tools

| **Anchoring** | First information influences all subsequent judgments | Pricing displays | Show value, not manipulate |
| **Social Proof** | People follow others' behavior | User testimonials | Genuine reviews only |
| **Scarcity** | Perceived rarity increases value | Limited-time offers | Real limitations only |
| **Authority** | Deference to expertise | Expert recommendations | Legitimate expertise |
| **Reciprocity** | Obligation to return favors | Free trials, content | Genuine value provision |

### The Psychology of Decision Making

How users make decisions in SaaS environments:

**D** - **Define** the problem clearly
**E** - **Establish** criteria for solutions
**C** - **Consider** alternatives
**I** - **Identify** best alternatives

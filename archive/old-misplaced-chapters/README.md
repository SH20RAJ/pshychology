# Archive: Old Misplaced Chapters

## What's in this directory

This directory contains chapters that were originally placed in `part-2-behavioral-psychology` but did not match the index.md structure for Part II.

## Original chapters archived:
- `chapter-04-psychology-persuasion-saas.md` - Psychology of Persuasion content
- `chapter-05-habit-formation-user-retention.md` - Habit Formation content (now properly located in Part IV, Chapter 12)
- `chapter-06-social-psychology-network-effects.md` - Social Psychology content

## Why they were moved:
According to the index.md, Part II should contain:
- Chapter 4: Visual Psychology & Interface Design
- Chapter 5: Interaction Psychology  
- Chapter 6: Information Architecture Psychology
- Chapter 7: Cognitive Load Management

The original chapters were likely drafts or belonged to different parts of the book structure.

## Current correct structure:
Part II chapters are now properly aligned with the index and located in:
`/chapters/part-2-psychology-driven-design/`

## Date archived:
December 2024

## References updated:
- Fixed references in Part III chapters to point to correct habit formation chapter location
- Updated index.md with proper navigation links to new Part II chapters

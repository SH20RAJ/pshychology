# Chapter 6: User Behavior Patterns

*Understanding how users navigate interfaces and the psychological patterns that drive their interactions*

---

## üéØ **Chapter Overview**

This chapter explores the psychological foundations of user behavior in digital interfaces, including:

- **Navigation Psychology**: How users explore and find information
- **Decision-Making Patterns**: The mental processes behind user choices
- **Attention and Focus**: What captures and maintains user attention
- **Habit Formation**: How interfaces can encourage repeated use
- **Error Psychology**: Why users make mistakes and how to prevent them

---

## üß† **Key Psychological Concepts**

### Mental Models and Navigation
- **Information Scent**: How users predict where to find information
- **Satisficing Behavior**: Choosing "good enough" options instead of optimal ones
- **Path Dependency**: How previous choices influence future decisions
- **Cognitive Mapping**: Building mental representations of interface structure

### Attention and Scanning Patterns
- **Banner Blindness**: Users ignore banner-like information
- **F-Pattern Reading**: Horizontal then vertical scanning behavior
- **Serial Position Effect**: Better recall for first and last items
- **Change Blindness**: Failing to notice interface changes

### Decision Psychology
- **Choice Architecture**: How option presentation affects decisions
- **Paradox of Choice**: Too many options can decrease satisfaction
- **Anchoring Effect**: First option influences subsequent choices
- **Default Bias**: Tendency to stick with pre-selected options

## üé® **Design Applications**

### Navigation Design
```
Breadcrumb Psychology:
- Reduces anxiety about getting lost
- Provides sense of control and orientation
- Supports both linear and exploratory navigation
- Builds confidence in interface structure

Menu Psychology:
- 7¬±2 rule for menu item counts
- Categorization based on user mental models
- Progressive disclosure for complex navigation
- Consistent positioning for predictability
```

### Interaction Patterns
```
Progressive Disclosure:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Maintains user focus
- Supports different expertise levels
- Creates sense of accomplishment

Confirmation Patterns:
- Prevents destructive actions
- Builds user confidence
- Provides opportunity for reconsideration
- Reduces support burden
```

## üìä **Behavioral Analysis Techniques**

### User Research Methods
- **Task Analysis**: Understanding user goals and workflows
- **Journey Mapping**: Visualizing complete user experiences  
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Tracking actual usage patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing different behavioral interventions

### Key Metrics
- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of completed tasks
- **Time on Task**: Efficiency of task completion
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of user mistakes
- **Navigation Efficiency**: Directness of paths to goals

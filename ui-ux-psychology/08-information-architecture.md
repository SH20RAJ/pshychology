# Chapter 8: Information Architecture Psychology

*How users organize, categorize, and find information in digital interfaces*

---

## üéØ **Chapter Overview**

This chapter explores the psychological foundations of information organization and findability:

- **Mental Models of Organization**: How users expect information to be structured
- **Categorization Psychology**: The cognitive processes behind grouping information
- **Search Behavior**: How users look for and evaluate information
- **Navigation Psychology**: Mental models of wayfinding in digital spaces
- **Information Scent**: How users predict where to find what they need

## üß† **Cognitive Organization Principles**

### Mental Models of Structure
```
Hierarchical Models:
- Tree-like structures (folders, categories)
- Parent-child relationships
- Breadth vs. depth trade-offs
- Inheritance of properties

Network Models:
- Interconnected information
- Multiple pathways to content
- Associative relationships
- Cross-references and links

Sequential Models:
- Step-by-step processes
- Linear progression
- Chronological organization
- Workflow-based structure
```

### Categorization Psychology
```
Basic Level Categories:
- Most natural level of categorization
- Balance between specificity and generality
- Easiest to name and remember
- Examples: "Chair" vs. "Furniture" vs. "Office Chair"

Prototype Theory:
- Categories organized around typical examples
- Fuzzy boundaries between categories
- Some members more central than others
- Cultural variation in prototypes
```

## üóÇÔ∏è **Information Architecture Patterns**

### Navigation Structures
```
Broad vs. Deep:
- Broad: More options at each level (reduces clicks)
- Deep: Fewer options at each level (reduces choice overload)
- Optimal: 7¬±2 categories at each level
- Context-dependent trade-offs

Hub and Spoke:
- Central hub connects to specialized areas
- Clear entry and exit points
- Supports both exploration and targeted tasks
- Works well for diverse user needs

Faceted Navigation:
- Multiple organizational schemes
- Users can filter by different attributes
- Supports different mental models
- Requires careful attribute selection
```

### Search Psychology
```
Information Seeking Behavior:
- Berry-picking: Evolving search strategy
- Satisficing: Accepting "good enough" results
- Orienteering: Using landmarks and cues
- Information scent: Following promising trails

Search Interface Design:
- Autocomplete reduces cognitive load
- Filters help narrow down results
- Sorting options match user priorities
- Clear result formatting aids scanning

## üé® **Design Applications**

### Card Sorting and Mental Models
```
Open Card Sorting:
- Reveals user mental models
- Identifies natural categories
- Uncovers terminology preferences
- Shows category relationships

Closed Card Sorting:
- Tests proposed structures
- Validates design decisions
- Compares alternative organizations
- Measures category effectiveness
```

### Wayfinding and Orientation
```
Orientation Cues:
- Breadcrumbs show current location
- Site maps provide overview
- Section indicators show progress
- Consistent navigation builds confidence

Landmark Design:
- Distinctive visual elements
- Memorable page identifiers
- Clear section boundaries
- Consistent placement patterns
```

## 🧠 **Why Psychology Matters in UI/UX**

### The Hidden Mental Processes
- **Unconscious Decision Making**: 95% of decisions happen subconsciously

- **Emotional Processing**: Emotions are processed 5x faster than rational thoughts
- **Memory Limitations**: Working memory can only hold 7±2 items at once

### Business Impact
- **Conversion Rates**: Proper psychological design can increase conversions by 200-400%
- **User Retention**: Emotionally connected users are 3x more likely to stay
- **Brand Perception**: First impressions form in 50 milliseconds
- **Error Reduction**: Good mental models reduce user errors by up to 80%

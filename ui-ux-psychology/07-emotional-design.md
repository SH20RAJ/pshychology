- Colors, shapes, and visual harmony
- Immediate emotional response
- Instinctive judgments about quality

Behavioral Level (Usability):
- Functionality and performance
- Ease of use and efficiency
- User control and feedback
- Task completion satisfaction

Reflective Level (Meaning):
- Self-image and social significance
- Personal meaning and values
- Long-term satisfaction
- Brand relationship and identity
```

### Emotional States in UX
```
Positive Emotions:
- Joy: Playful interactions, celebrations

## ‚ú® **Microinteractions Psychology**

### The Anatomy of Microinteractions
```
1. Trigger: What initiates the interaction
2. Rules: What happens during the interaction
3. Feedback: How users know what happened
4. Loops & Modes: Meta-rules for the interaction
```

- **Create Habit**: Encourages repeated use
